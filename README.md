### Websichanic

Project URL: [View live project](https://websichanic.herokuapp.com "Websichanic")

![Mockup]()

## Summary

Websichanic short for "website mechanic" an idea based on TextMechanic, a site I have used and known a long time. A user can manipulate text, like removing empty lines, trim lines and empty spaces. Tools like removing dubplicates and adding string(s) before or/and after a line etc. It's a good toolset to have when working with text. I wanted to something something similar and based on that idea I came up with websichanic. An app that takes an input and gives feedback to the user, a question came to life, to who?

I asked myself, what's current need based on my current surounding. Developers! So I set out to build something that could be used by developers that could potientially save them time, as time is limited, we all wouldn't hesitate saving time where possible and Websichanic was born.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to understand the site's primary purpose quickly.
        2. I want to use the app without any issues.
        3. I want the app to continue on until I close the program.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. I want the app to perform as new.
        2. I want the app to offer quick access to it's options.
        2. I want the app to provide a help doc. if needed.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The app uses three main colors which are:
            
            | #HEX | Color |
            |:--------:|:--------:|
            | #26396A |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/26396a.png)|
            | #444655 |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/444655.png)|
            | #A8AABC |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/a8aabc.png)|

            The background image was produced by the shades of the main three colors.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   All images have been created by myself and serves the purpose of make the app more appealing.
        -   The colors and images all serve to be aligned and assist in the name and branding of app.
        -   They also intent to give the app an identity the user can relate to, lifting it's overall impression.

*   ### Wireframes

    -   Mockflow.com was used to design the initial layout for the desktop screen.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Mockflow:](https://mockflow.com/)
    - Mockflow was used to create the [wireframes](#wireframes) during the design process.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.
1. [Requests:](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
    - Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.
1. [html5lib:](https://pypi.org/project/html5lib/)
    - html5lib is a pure-python library for parsing HTML. It is designed to conform to the WHATWG HTML specification, as is implemented by all major web browsers.
1. [bs4:](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
    - Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

### Dev HTML

The base HTML that came with the initial template was used and slightly altered to move the button below the terminal. Two extra tags where added to give me more freedom to better control the layout of the app.

### Dev CSS

Initially I had a small fight with Heroku and finally after some time, I realized it was out of the scope of this project. I ended up adding CSS code to layout.html instead of a custom styles.css file.

### Images

There's two images shown on the app, one in the `<body>` background set to be shown below or behind the python terminal, and the favicon to further strengthen the branding of the app.
