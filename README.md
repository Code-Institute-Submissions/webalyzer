## Summary




## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to understand the site's primary purpose quickly.
        2. I want the app to give options related to it's branding.
        3. I want to use the app without any issues.
        4. I want the app to continue on until I close the program. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. I want the app to offer quick access to it's options.
        2. I want the app to provide a help doc. if needed.

-   ### Design
    
    -   #### Wireframe

        Mockflow.com was used to design the initial layout for the desktop screen only, as the project requirements does not include or mention mobile responsiveness.

        | Desktop |
        |:--------:|
        | ![Front](./assets/images/readme/wc-wireframe-min.png) |

        <br>

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The app uses three main colors which are:
            
            | #HEX | Color |
            |:--------:|:--------:|
            | #26396A |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/26396a.png)|
            | #444655 |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/444655.png)|
            | #A8AABC |![Gradient Palette](./assets/images/readme/a8aabc.png)|

            The background image was produced by the shades of the main three colors.

            <br>

    -   #### Imagery

        -   I created the images myself and was created to make the app more appealing.
        -   The colors and images all serve to be aligned and assist in the name and branding of app.
        -   They also intent to give the app an identity the user can relate to, lifting it's overall impression.

        <br>

        The background image was produced using adobe's illustrator as it is my preferred tool for working on svg files.

        The favicon image was produced using adobe's illustrator as well.

## Planes


<br>

### Surface

What will the product actually look like, what colors, what typography, what images/design elements, what animation, what transitions, how will the final product look like?
<br>

### Skeleton

(How the infomation implemented), (how will the user navigate), (how the content relate to each other, low, mid top priority, how and where to position content)?
<br>

### Structure

The structure of app should not be more than 3 levels deep and should be user friendly so that the user quickly finds what the user wants. Below is a chart showcasing the logic structure and functionality of the app.

<br>

### Scope

#### Minimum viable product

The minimum feature the app must contain includes the following features:

- To validate the HTML spec standard meta tags names.

- To validate the HTML of a webpage and receive the validation response.

- To validate the CSS of a webpage and receive the validation response.

- To validate the Javascript of a website and receive the validation response.

- To be able to scrape the meta tags of a website and saved to a CSV file.

- To be able to scrape the content of a webpage and analyze the content.

- To be able to scrape and validate all links of a webpage.

#### Desired features

The desired features the app could contain includes the following features:

- To validate the Python code of a file and report the validation response.

- To be able to add bulk URLs to validate/analyze.

<br>

### Strategy

Websichanic, short for "website mechanic" based on real world website -TextMechanic, a site I have used and known for a long time. A user can manipulate text, like removing empty lines, trim lines and empty spaces. Tools like removing duplicates and adding string(s) before or/and after a line etc. It's a good toolset to have when working with text. I wanted to create something similar and based on "TM" I came up with Websichanic. An app that takes an input and gives feedback to the user.

I asked myself, what's current need based on my current surounding. Web Developers! Both new and senior web developers. Questions comes to mind like; what could be used by web developers, that could potientially save time? What features could be desired? As a web developer saving time where possible is and will be always good, as time is limited.

<br>

## Development

#### Languages Used

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Wikipedia's CSS3 page")
- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Wikipedia's Python page")

<br>

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Mockflow:](https://mockflow.com/)
    - Mockflow was used to create the [wireframe](#wireframe) during the design process.
2. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
3. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.
4. [Heroku:](https://www.heroku.com)
    - Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
5. [Requests:](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
    - Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.
6. [html5lib:](https://pypi.org/project/html5lib/)
    - html5lib is a pure-python library for parsing HTML. It is designed to conform to the WHATWG HTML specification, as is implemented by all major web browsers.
7. [bs4:](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
    - Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
8. [sys:](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
    - This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.
9. [time:](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
    - This module provides various time-related functions.

    <br>

### Dev HTML

The base HTML that came with the initial template was used and slightly altered to move the button below the terminal. Two extra tags where added to give me more freedom to better control the layout of the app.

<br>

### Dev CSS

Initially I had a small fight with Heroku and finally after some time, I realized it was out of the scope of this project. I ended up adding CSS code to layout.html instead of a custom stylesheet file.
